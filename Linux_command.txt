YUM: Yellowdog Updater Modified

   uninstall them, and update an entire system to the latest available version. 

#yum list postgresql*
#yum list all											   Lists all installed and available packages.
#yum list installed                                        Lists all packages installed on your system. The rightmost column in the output lists the 
														   repository from which the package was retrieved.

#yum makecache                                             to make sure that the cache is fully up to date with all metadata.
#yum clean all											   To remove all entries for currently enabled repositories from the cache
#yum repolist enabled                                      check and verify new repositories are configured. it shows all configured repo

-> Configuring Proxy Server Access for a Single User:
   -> the profile is the file ~/.bash_profile. The settings below enable yum to use the proxy server mycache.mydomain.com, 
      connecting to port 3128.
	 # The Web proxy server used by this account
       http_proxy="http://mycache.mydomain.com:3128"
       export http_proxy
	       or

------- Selinux ---------------
-> There is three mode of Security Enhanced in the Rhel 7:
   1. enforcing
   2. permissive
   3. Disabled                 // note:  In order to swap to the disabled mode, a system REBOOT will be required.
-> Q) check selinux status:
   #getenforce
   #sestatus
   Note: both of these show that we are current mode.
-> different ways to change the mode of Selinux:
   1. SELinux Runtime Configuration
      #setenforce 0              // to swap to permissive mode
	  #setenforce 1             // to swap to enforcing mode
      Note: We cannot disable selinux at runtime, as swapping to or from the disabled mode requires a system reboot.
   2. SELinux Persistent Configuration:
      -> edit the /etc/selinux/config text file with our persistent setting, either enforcing, permissive, or disabled.
	  -> simply edit the SELINUX variable between enforcing, permissive, or disabled.
	  -> change after system reboot.
-> Disable the Linux firewall(rhel 7).

    -> for RHEL 7
	            #systemctl disable firewalld
	root_prompt #service firewalld stop              // stop firewall service but again started after os reboot
	root_prompt #service firewalld start             // start firewall service
	root_prompt #systemctl disable firewalld         // disable the firewall. it make sure service will not start even 
	                                                    after os reboot
	root_prompt #systemctl enable firewalld          // to again enable the firewall
	root_prompt #systemctl stop firewalld            // not sure about this command
	root_prompt #systemctl mask firewalld            // not sure about this command
	                    OR
    -> for RHEL 6
	root_prompt #service iptables stop
	root_prompt #chkconfig ipchains off
	root_prompt #chkconfig iptables off
---> what i use:
    -> Before stop the iptables, save the firewall setting
       #service iptables save
	   #service iptables stop
	   #service iptables status
	-> To ensure that iptables will not started at boot time
	   #chkconfig iptables off
	-> If IPv6 firewall is enabled, please disable it
	   #service ip6tables save
	   #service ip6tables stop
	   #service ip6tables status
	-> To ensure that iptables will not started at boot time
	   #chkconfig ip6tables off
	
----------------------- Q&A ------------
Q) How to search multiple string in vim?
Ans:Example: /StringOne\|StringTwo
              OR 
    />>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\|<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
Q) what is use of ~/.bash_profile file in linux?
Ans: The .bash_profile file is a personal initialization file for configuring the user environment.
   like .bash_profile there are others initialization file:
    /etc/profile	
	~/.bash_login
	~/.bash_logout
   
Q) what are the partitions in the linux fils system?
Q) How to check which file system is using how much disk space?   hint: df -h
Q) how to extend default file system size to the new size on RHEL 7.4?
Ans: 
	 fdisk -l  .... vgdisplay ....... pvdisplay
	 lvs
	 df -h
	 lvextend -L+5G /dev/mapper/VolGroup00-root_vol      <- it will provide the 5GB space to the logical volume
	 xfs_growfs /dev/mapper/VolGroup00-root_vol           <-   it will expend the volume
Q) how to change the version of active java if installed multiple java on the rhel system?
Ans: -> while executing this command it might get failed with error:
	  "install the require JVM on your target system"
	 follow the below steps as suggested on the putty console:
	 #java -version
	 #alternatives --config java
	    4             (provide 4 as input)
	 it will ask you to select option to select what you software you want to select( i select 4 for java 1.8)
	 -> now we can run "java --version" to check what java version is active on the server
	-> change the version of java : 
	   #alternatives --config java                //alternatives utility may not install on the server then install using yum
	-> #javac -version
	-> to change the version of Javac:
	   #/usr/sbin/alternatives --config javac 
Q) How to set environment variable in linux? like defined JAVA_HOME environment variable:

Q) what is rhel upgrade command?
Ans:"#yum update" will update all OS software. You should then reboot the machine (or the impacted services) so that the 
    latest shared libraries/kernel are used.
   -> If your solution only supports a given RHEL minor version then don't use the above command as it will also update you to the latest RHEL minor version when available.
   -> minor release update means. it will update the rhel 6.x to 6.y which is the latest in that repo.
 NOTE: a minor release is NOT the latest security fixes. 
   means minor release may not have the latest security fixes. there would be some repo where hpe people would have 
   keep the latest security patches to install it for the same minor version of rhel.
        -> so to upgrade the security patches, we are not suppose to upgrade the rhel minor version but instead we 
		should add the repo where latest patches are available and update it from there with command:
	     #yum install --security     // will update the security patches 
       
Q) Command to remove old kernel package and keep only the latest one?
Ans:# package-cleanup --oldkernels --count=1
    // few other rpm related to kernel may not removed then need to removed using rpm. ex:
	#rpm -e kernel-debug-devel-2.6.32-696.el6.x86_64

Q) If two linux machine is not connecting using ssh but i am able to login both of them from windows. then prblm is?

=================================== Unix FileSystem ==============================
-> /opt: /opt is reserved for the installation of add-on application software packages.
         -> A package to be installed in /opt must locate its static files in a separate /opt/<package> or /opt/<provider> directory tree, where <package> is a name that describes the software package and <provider> is the provider's LANANA registered name.
		 -> Programs to be invoked by users must be located in the directory /opt/<package>/bin.
		 -> If the package includes UNIX manual pages, they must be located in /opt/<package>/share/man.
		    like: /opt/OC/share/man/man1
		 -> Package files that are variable (change in normal operation) must be installed in /var/opt.
		 -> Host-specific configuration files must be installed in /etc/opt.
		 -> No other package files may exist outside the /opt, /var/opt, and /etc/opt
-> /etc: The /etc hierarchy contains configuration files. A "configuration file" is a local file used to control the operation of a program; 
         -> it must be static and cannot be an executable binary. 
		 -> Host-specific configuration files for add-on application software packages must be installed within the directory /etc/opt/<subdir>
-> /var: /var contains variable data files. This includes spool directories and files, administrative and logging data, and transient and temporary
         files.
		 /var/opt/<subdir>: contains the variable files of the add-on software.
