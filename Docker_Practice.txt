-> How to Make container accessible from host machine?
Ans: port mapping. 
-> Can Host directly access to container service using container IP without using Port mapping concept?
-> Can Container access application/service from host machine?                  ????????????????
Ans: yes. Container can access Host application service(using port) by using docker0 interface Ip address.
  Solution: You may need to modify the iptables rules on your host to permit connections from Docker containers. Something like this will do the trick:
     #iptables -A INPUT -i docker0 -j ACCEPT
  172.17.0.1 host machine docker0 interface ip address
  172.17.0.2 ip address of container c1
-> How to access outside world from container through host machine:
And: 
  -> login to host machine and follow below steps
   - #firewall-cmd --list-all
   - #firewall-cmd --permanent --add-masquerade    // by default value will be No. 
   - #firewall-cmd --reload                        // after installation it will become yes.
 -> now login to container and try to access internet. 
-> how two container can communicate between each other?
