   1. download jenkin.war file or jenkins msi setup file
   2. for war file we can deploy it in the jboss server or we can install the jenkins msi file
   3. access the url "http:\\localhost:8080" in the browser it will open the jenkin dashboard
-> set up maven for creating maven project:
   download maven Binary.zip file from maven site and put to any location here: c:\usr\project
   configure the the maven in jenkins:
    dashboard -> manage jenkins -> configure system -> in the maven section "Add maven" button -> Uncheck the ‘Install automatically’ option. Add any name for the setting and the location of the MAVEN_HOME.
-> install plugin:
   manage Jenkins -> manage plugin -> install git plugin
-> now creating job, we will create a project "maven" and under that "source code management section will have git"

	  "allow user to sign up"  -> it will show option on login page to "create user"
